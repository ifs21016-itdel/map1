Hey, I'm Mike, the author of Colliders Editor Tools and I want to thank you sincerely for buying my work.
The instructions needed to get started are available as a pdf in the folder BigBlit/Eddie/CollidersEditorTools/Guide.pdf

Support for 2020LTS has been added.
For Unity 2020LTS, 2021.1 and 2021.2 you have to use legacy toolbar activated through "Edit/Preferences/Colliders Editor Tools" tab.

If something doesn't work.... don't panic! :)
Please send a description of the problem along with the Unity version you are using to bigblit@protonmail.com, I usually reply within a few hours and bugs are dealt with as quickly as possible.

Hope the package 'il serve you well!
Mike, BigBlit.
